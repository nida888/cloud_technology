                <p class="about">Barbie is a fashion doll created by Mattel, Inc. She is known for her fashionable outfits and accessories.
                    The first-ever Barbie doll was introduced by the American toy company Mattel, Inc. in March 1959. The doll was named "Barbie" after Ruth Handler, one of the co-founders of Mattel, observed her daughter, Barbara, playing with paper dolls and imagining them as adult women. Ruth Handler envisioned a three-dimensional adult-like fashion doll for girls, and that idea led to the creation of Barbie.
The original Barbie doll was 11.5 inches (29 cm) tall and had a mature, adult-like figure. She was dressed in a black-and-white striped swimsuit and came with accessories such as sunglasses, high-heeled shoes, and hoop earrings. The first Barbie doll was marketed as a teenage fashion model and quickly became a cultural icon and a popular toy for generations of children.
Since the introduction of the first Barbie, the doll has undergone numerous changes in terms of design, outfits, careers, and diversity to reflect the evolving tastes and values of society. Barbie remains a well-known and beloved toy around the world.

            Stereotypical Barbie (“Barbie”) and fellow dolls reside in Barbieland; a matriarchal society with different variations of Barbies, Kens, and a group of discontinued models, who are treated like outcasts due to their unconventional traits. While the Kens spend their days playing at the beach, considering it as their profession, the Barbies hold prestigious jobs such as doctors, lawyers, and politicians. Beach Ken (“Ken”) is only happy when he is with Barbie and seeks a closer relationship, but Barbie rebuffs him in favor of other activities and female friendships.

        <p class="music">
            Music producers Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt enlisted quite the starry bunch for the soundtrack, including Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice for the original track "Barbie World," which samples from Aqua's "Barbie Girl." In the song, they use the concept of "Barbie World" to express themes related to a glamorous and extravagant lifestyle, much like the image often associated with Barbie dolls.
